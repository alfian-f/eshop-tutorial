## Reflection 1
1. I added two new features â€“ the option to edit and delete products. When working on these features, I kept the code clean by using clear and easy-to-understand names for variables and functions. I also followed a simple and organized development approach by creating separate branches for each feature using Git Flow. If I were to improve my code, I would probably focus more on secure coding. I don't think I really do much about secure coding practices, and adding comments for better clarity is also something I plan to do in the future.

## Reflection 2 
1. I feel confident that the feature that I just added can run smoothly. For each function or method, it's essential to have corresponding unit tests that cover various scenarios like valid inputs, edge cases, and errors. The aim is to ensure sufficient test coverage to catch potential issues. 

	While code coverage is a useful metric indicating how much code is tested, achieving 100% coverage doesn't guarantee a bug-free application. It simply means every line is executed at least once, but thorough test case design is essential to cover all possible paths and scenarios.

2. it's crucial to maintain code cleanliness. The cleanliness of the code ensures readability and maintainability and reduces the likelihood of bugs appearing. However, duplication of setup procedures and instance variables across multiple test suites can impact code quality. We can extract common setup logic and instance variables into a separate method or class to resolve the duplication of setup procedures.
